# Reproducibility Notes

Uploaded / imported the notebook [into colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1T0ED71rbhiNF8HG-769aBqA0zZAJodcd), then select "File" > "Download .py" and store the result in the "start" dir.

## Database Queries

Counting users and tweets:

```sql
SELECT
  count(DISTINCT user_id) as user_count -- 3,600,545
  ,count(DISTINCT status_id) as tweet_count -- 67,655,058
FROM impeachment_production.tweets
```

Counting users and tweets per month:

```sql
SELECT
  EXTRACT(YEAR from created_at) as year
  ,EXTRACT(MONTH from created_at) as month
  ,min(EXTRACT(DAY from created_at)) as first_day
  ,max(EXTRACT(DAY from created_at)) as last_day
  ,count(DISTINCT status_id) as tweet_count
  ,count(DISTINCT user_id) as user_count
FROM impeachment_production.tweets
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 1,2
```

year	| month	| first_day	| last_day  | tweet_count	| user_count
---	    | ---	| ---	    | ---       | ---	        | ---
2019	| 12	| 2	        | 31        | 18,239,072	| 1,860,878
2020	| 1	    | 1	        | 31        | 31,504,261	| 2,105,059
2020	| 2	    | 1	        | 29        | 14,207,862	| 1,416,178
2020	| 3	    | 1	        | 24        | 3,715,362	    | 789,737

Over 67.6M tweets from over 3.6M users were collected during the period from December 2, 2019 through March 24, 2020.

## Database Migrations

Let's create a table of unique user ids and prepare to assemble network graphs:

```sql
```
